# THIS MODULE IS NO LONGER NECESSARY AS A BETTER VERSION HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY IMPLEMENTED. I WOULD ADVISE UNINSTALLING AND USING THE OFFICAL VERSION INSTEAD.
# ATTENTION

THIS IS A FORK OF A MODULE WRIITEN BY http://coleschultz.dev/, THE ORIGINAL FORK CAN BE FOUND HERE https://github.com/schultzcole/FVTT-Skill-Customization-5e I SIMPLY UPDATED IT TO MATCH THE CURRENT FOUNDRY SYSTEM FOR MY PERSONAL USE. I HAVE RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM COLE TO PUBLISH IT HERE FOR WIDESPREAD USE.

Additionally this works for me and I did extensive bug testing with it but I am not a professional coder. I currently have not found any bugs but if any are found please do not bother cole with issues related to this fork and raise the issue here instead.

# Skill Customization for D&D5E

Gives the ability to apply arbitrary flat bonuses to skill rolls as well as changing the base ability modifier a skill roll uses.

## Preview

![Preview](preview.jpg)

As you can see, this module adds a drop down to select the base ability, as well as a box to enter an arbitrary bonus to each skill.

## Compatibility

May or may not work with all custom sheets or modules that modify rolling.

Original fork Confirmed compatibility with Tidy5e Sheet, Alt5e Sheet, and Better Rolls for 5e, I have yet to confirm compatability however I have not changed anything that may affect this.

Makes use of libWrapper to reduce likelihood of conflicts. Installing libWrapper is not required to make use of this module.
